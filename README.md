# MVNO
Mobile Virtual Network Operator 

## Introduction
<p>The MVNO concept is a very attractive option for such a “specialist”, aiming at drastically reducing the required resources (investment, headcount and roll-out time) and allowing the new entrant to focus on the really critical, market-side success factors. As there is no need for a spectrum license, a lengthy, complex and expensive radio network roll-out, or ongoing maintenance of the latter, market entry barriers are much lower than for a full mobile network operator (MNO). </p>
